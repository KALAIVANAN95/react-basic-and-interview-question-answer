State changes can be asynchronous.
State is mutable.
State holds information about the components.

29.Differentiate between stateless and stateful components.
stateless:
It is simple and easy to understand.
It is also known as a functional component.

stateful:
It is complex as compared to the stateless component.
It is also known as a class component.

30.Hooks?
React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component.
Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects.
useState:
To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.
useEffect: 
To manage side-effects like API calls, subscriptions, timers, mutations, and more.
componentDidmount and componentdidupdate - it will be done this work
useContext: 
To return the current value for a context.
useReducer:
A useState alternative to help with complex state management.
useCallback: 
It returns a memorized version of a callback to help a child component not re-render unnecessarily.
useMemo:
It returns a memoized value that helps in performance optimizations.
The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
useRef:
It returns a ref object with a .current property. The ref object is mutable. It is mainly used to access a child component imperatively.
useLayoutEffect: 
It fires at the end of all DOM mutations. It's best to use useEffect as much as possible over this one as the useLayoutEffect fires synchronously.
useDebugValue:
Helps to display a label in React DevTools for custom hooks.

31.What is the diff btwn Clone and Create element in React?

let {name,value}=event.target;
let data = {[name]:value}
setobjec(...obje,...data)

}
