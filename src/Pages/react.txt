1.What is React JS?
i)It is a JavaScript library created by Facebook in 2011 by jordan Walke.
ii)It is used for building user interfaces and also used to build single page applications.

2.JSX?
i)JSX is a shorthand for JavaScript XML
ii)This makes the HTML file really easy to understand

3.What is the meaning of Virtual DOM.?
i)A virtual DOM is a simple JavaScript object that is the exact copy of the corresponding real DOM.
or
A virtual DOM is a light weight js object.

4.Why use React?
i)Easy creation of dynamic web apps
ii)Reusable Components
iii)Easy Debugging 
iv)Enhanced Performance
v)Unidirectional data flow

5.Can browsers read a JSX file.?
i)No, browsers cannot read JSX files directly.
ii)It can only read the objects provided by JavaScript.
or
No,Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a regular JavaScript object

6.What are States in React.?
i)States are used to easily create dynamic and interactive components
or
The state is a build-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component
or
State of component is an object that holds some data
This data influences the output of a component

7.What is a higher-order component in React.?
i)A higher-order component is a function that takes in a component and returns a new component.
Using code,const newComponent = higherFunction(WrappedComponent);

8.What are the three phases of a component life cycle in React.?
Mounting (adding nodes to the DOM)
Updating (altering existing nodes in the DOM)
Unmounting (removing nodes from the DOM)

9.What are events in React.?
i)An envent is an action that can be triggered by a user or any system event like pressing a key, a mouse click,etc

10.What is arrow function?
Arrow function is a short way of writing a function in React

11.What are components in React?
Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
A single app usally consists of multiple components.


12.What is the use of render() in React?
The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.
It is compulsory for each component to have a render() function

13.What are refs in React?
Refs are a function provided by React to access the DOM element and
the React element that you might have created on your own
Main uses:
i)To initiate imperative animations
ii)To join third party DOM libraries
iii)To manage focus and apply media playback

14.What are the components of Redux in React?
Redux consists of 4 main components as shown below:
i)Action: An object that describes the call
ii)Reducer:The state change storage unit
iii)Store:The state and object tree storage
iv)View:Displays data provided by the store

15.What are pure components in React?
The components that do not re-render when the value of props and 
state has been updated with the same values.

16.What are higher-order components used for?
i)Manipulation of props
ii)State manipulation and abstraction
iii)Render high jacking 
iv)Code reusing
v)Bootstrap abstraction

17.What are keys in React?
i)Keys are used to directly check if an item has been
added or removed from list

18.Props?
Props stands for propertues
It gives a way to pass data from one component to other component.

19.Callback function? JS
A Callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument.

20.What is props and state in React?
Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument. 
State holds information about the components

21.What are the three types of components?
Types of React Components Discussed
Functional Components.
Class Components.
Pure Components.
Higher-Order Components.

22.What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?
Real DOM:
The real DOM updates slower.
The real DOM can directly update HTML.
There is a lot of memory wastage in The real DOM.

Virtual DOM:
The virtual DOM updates faster
The virtual DOM cannot directly update HTML.
There is no memory wastage in the virtual DOM.

23.what is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
Controlled:
It does not maintain its internal state.
data is controlled by the parent component.
It accepts its current value as a prop.
It allows validation control.
Uncontrolled:
It maintains its internal states.
data is controlled by the DOM itself
It uses a ref for their current values.
It does not allow validation control.

24.What are the feature of React.?
JSX,Component,one-way data binding,virtual dom,simplicity & performance.

25.What is the biggest limitaition of React?
React is just library, it is not a complete framework.

26.Flux.?
Flux is an application architecture that Facebook uses intrnally for the 
building the client side web app.

27.Redux.?
Redux is an open-source JS library used to manage application state.
React uses redux for building the user interface.

28.Differentiate between States and Props.
Props:
Props are read-only
Props are immutable.
Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.

State:
State changes can be asynchronous.
State is mutable.
State holds information about the components.

29.Differentiate between stateless and stateful components.
stateless:
It is simple and easy to understand.
It is also known as a functional component.

stateful:
It is complex as compared to the stateless component.
It is also known as a class component.

30.Hooks?
React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component.
Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects.
useState:
To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.
useEffect: 
To manage side-effects like API calls, subscriptions, timers, mutations, and more.
componentDidmount and componentdidupdate - it will be done this work
useContext: 
To return the current value for a context.
useReducer:
A useState alternative to help with complex state management.
useCallback: 
It returns a memorized version of a callback to help a child component not re-render unnecessarily.
useMemo:
It returns a memoized value that helps in performance optimizations.
The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
useRef:
It returns a ref object with a .current property. The ref object is mutable. It is mainly used to access a child component imperatively.
useLayoutEffect: 
It fires at the end of all DOM mutations. It's best to use useEffect as much as possible over this one as the useLayoutEffect fires synchronously.
useDebugValue:
Helps to display a label in React DevTools for custom hooks.

31.What is the diff btwn Clone and Create element in React?
i)cloneElement is primarily used to clone an element
& pass it to new props directly
ii)Whereas, createElemnt is the entity that JSX get complied into.This is also used to create elements in React	

const getChange = (event)=>{
let {name,value}=event.target;
let data = {[name]:value}
setobjec(...obje,...data)

}
